## Personal Journal

Each student must maintain a very simple personal journal.

#### Why

Your journal is a simple, low-overhead mechanism for getting you to be
_reflective_, to think _deliberately_ and _systematically_ about your
progress in this course, and for you to communicate
that to your tutor.

#### When

From week two onwards, you need to **commit and push** your journal at least
*five minutes before* your scheduled lab time.  Thoughtfully completing the
journal is a requirement of the course and what's committed prior to your scheduled
lab will be assessed by your tutor and reflected in your class engagement mark.

#### What

Each week, *starting in Week 1*, use the table below to answer five simple
questions:
* Respond to the statement '**Overall, I am happy with how I am going in this course**' (`1` strongly disagree, `2` disagree, `3` neutral, `4` agree, `5` strongly agree).
* Respond to the statement '**Overall, my assignment group is working well**' (`1` strongly disagree, `2` disagree, `3` neutral, `4` agree, `5` strongly agree) (week 4 onwards).
* **What have I done** for this class in the week to date?
* **What will I do** for this class in the week to come?
* **What impediments do I see** to making progress on my goals?

This is based loosely on the [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))
methodology often used in software engineering.   Your statements need only be  _brief_,
but they should be _carefully considered_.

The statements should be written with respect to the weeks before and after your
scheduled lab time. 
The journal serves three purposes.
First, it helps you reflect on how you are doing in the course.
Second, it helps your tutor understand how you're doing, making them better able to *help you*.
Third, it helps your lecturer understand how the whole class is doing, making him better able to *help the whole class*.

*Thoughtful* and *concise* entries are best.
