# COMP1110 Lab 6


## Before the Lab

* Complete Week 7 of your personal journal, commit and push at least 5 minutes prior to the start of your lab.

## Purpose

**Your tutor will mark your engagement during the lab.**

## Part I: 30-Minute Check-In

As usual, you will do _two_ things during the 30-minute check-in:

1.  Check in with **your tutor** together with the other members of your group.    Briefly outline any issues you're having that you'd particularly like help with during the lab (make sure you have your journal open and refer to it when you meet with your tutor).
2.  When you're not checking in with your tutor, you should be listening to the **lab leader** as they give an overview of what you'll be working through in this week's lab.

## Part II:  Your Lab Tasks

*This lab is under construction! We will announce on piazza when it is ready. Please do an upstream pull before you start working on the lab*
