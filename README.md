# COMP1110 Labs

### Before You Start

It is essential that you use streams to [enroll](https://cs.anu.edu.au/streams/) in a lab class before the end of Week 1.

### The Labs Repository

This repository is the basis for COMP1110/COMP1140/COMP6710 lab exercises.
In [Lab 1](src/comp1110/lab1/README.md), you will [**fork**](http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/fork-project.html) your own copy of this repository, which you will use for the remainder of the semester.
